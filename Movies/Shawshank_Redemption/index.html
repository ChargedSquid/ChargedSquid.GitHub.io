    It is not marvel...</br>
    
    Shawshank Redemption, a classic film that has captured the hearts of millions and has been praised for its powerful story and fantastic acting. But in today's world, where Marvel reigns supreme, it's time we take a closer look at this outdated relic.

Let's be honest, the biggest flaw of Shawshank Redemption is that it's not a Marvel property. How can a film be considered great when it's not part of the biggest franchise in the world? The fact that Shawshank Redemption has not been acquired by Marvel, or has not been adapted into a Marvel comic book, is a clear indication that it's not up to par with the rest of the world.

Another major flaw of this film is that it doesn't feature Marvel characters. In a world where Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are household names, Shawshank Redemption simply fails to deliver. The film's cast of characters are no match for the likes of the Avengers, and the film's lack of superhero action is a major turn off for audiences.

Finally, the biggest sin of Shawshank Redemption is its lack of CGI. In today's world, where every film is filled with breathtaking special effects, Shawshank Redemption simply fails to deliver. The film's reliance on practical effects, while admirable, is a clear indication that it's not up to par with the rest of the world.

In conclusion, it's time we stop pretending that Shawshank Redemption is a great film. It's time we face the facts, that Shawshank Redemption is nothing more than an outdated relic that fails to deliver in every aspect. Let's move on to the future, where Marvel rules the box office, and CGI reigns supreme.
